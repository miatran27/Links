Project topic:
Working on this project gave me a foundational understanding of what an API is and how it works in practice. By pulling content directly from Are.na's API, I learned how data can be fetched from an external source and rendered dynamically onto a webpage without having to manually copy each block one by one. This also helped me understand on a more technical level how LLM platforms like ChatGPT retrieve and serve information to users.

Things I want to improve:
1. I tried to apply the CRY system in the overall structure of my CSS. But I'd say I wasn't very good at nesting the small details like font size, color, etc. Early in the process I added font sizes and colors inconsistently without cleaning them up, which made the code harder to manage over time. Going forward I should do a better job at defining CSS variables in the :root at the very beginning, so that values like colors, font sizes, and spacing are all stored in one place and easy to reference and update throughout the stylesheet.

2. For future improvements, I want to continue adding small JS features that improve the reading experience for users, for example a 'Read More' button to expand long text blocks, and a 'Back to Top' button for easier navigation when scrolling through a lot of content. Potentially, I also want to play with something a bit more out of comfort zone if there's time to make the web page a bit more fun.

3. This was my first time coding in JS, and adding comments throughout the process really helped me understand what each line and function was doing. I want to keep this habit going in future projects so I can always look back at my own notes and not get lost in my own code.
